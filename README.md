###  What is NFT Museum ? <a name = "what"></a>

NFT Museum is a mobile first platform authenticated by multiple Crypto Wallets including Valora for art lovers to curate their favourite digital art pieces as a collection and be shared to community. A curator ( user who creates collection) can add multiple NFTs from OpenSea and create a collection by theme, asthetics or free will, just like a Spotify playlists !
These collections are visible to everyone, searchable by Tags and number of likes.
